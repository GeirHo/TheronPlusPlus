				// if the list is in an organised state, a simple access to one of
				// the infrequently sent messages will will destroy the organisation
				// and it will take many messages before the list is again organised.

				// Alternatively, the received message can be moved k elements forward
				// in the list. A compromise between these two is to move the element
				// to position k+1 if it it is in the end part of the list (move
				// almost to front), and the transpose the element with the element
				// in front if it is in the 2..k positions of the list. This
				// heuristic is known as the POS(k) rule. Two different strategies
				// are suggested in Oommen et al. (1990): "Deterministic optimal and
				// expedient move-to-rear list organizing strategies", Theoretical
				// Computer Science, Vol. 74, No. 2, pp. 183-197. Their first and
				// optimal strategy implies keeping a counter for each element, and
				// then move the accessed element to the rear of the list once it has
				// been accessed T times. Their expedient strategy implies moving the
				// element to the rear of the list when it has been accessed T
				// consecutive times. The implementation cost of the first rule would
				// be similar to keeping a map sorted on the number of times each
				// message has arrived - and this map will obviously be exact. Waiting
				// for T consecutive accesses for an element may again be too slow.

				// The transposition rule suggested by Ronald Rivest (1976): "On
				// self-organizing sequential search heuristics", Communications of
				// the ACM, Vol. 19, No. 2, pp. 63-67 is much more efficient. Here a
				// successfully constructed message will be swapped with the element
