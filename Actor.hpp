Actor

This is a minimalistic implementation of the actor system aiming to rectify
some of the issues with Theron and basing it strictly on modern C++ principles.
The design goals are

1. Do not redo what C++ has as standard: This includes using the standard
   memory allocation mechanism. This should also ensure full portability.
   The compiler should be able to handle the magic.
2. Simplicity. The main consequence of this is that the actors are supposed
   to run on one computer with shared memory
3. Respect the Theron interface. One should be able to replace the Theron main
   header with this and recompile. For this reason, there is no dedicated
   documentation of the API since one can simply read Theron's documentation.

Currently there is no scheduler. The operating system's thread scheduler is
used. Each actor has its own thread for executing its message handlers. This is
based on the assumption that the system has sufficient memory, and that a
thread not running is not consuming CPU. The actual scheduling of active threads
on the CPU cores should be most efficient in this way. However, one should
measure, and if the execution environment cannot cope with this policy a
thread pool and a scheduling policy can be implemented, although it currently
contradicts the second design principle.

 Actor identification

=============================================================================*/
//
// Addressing an actor in Theron requires an address object, which can exist
// with or without the existence of the actor it refers to, and the address is
// resolved to an actor only when a message is sent to this actor. Invalid
// addresses are only indicated by the negative result of a message sending.
// There is no way for an actor to detect a priori that an address is invalid,
// and as such the actor address is just like an encapsulated string. Hence,
// there must be an address class (to be defined below).

public:
class Address;

// The consequence of this model is that addresses can be used, for instance
// as keys in lookup tables, and they can outlive the actor addressed. At the
// same time one should be able to look up address by name (string) or by
// numerical ID. In order to ensure transparent actor communication, i.e. the
// actor sending a message should not need to know if the receiver is a local
// actor or a remote actor, the address does not need to point to a physical
// memory location of a local actor.
//
// Furthermore, there are temporal aspects. An actor can be known by its name
// before it is created, making it logically indistinguishable from a remote
// actor. Then when the actor is created it should no longer be taken as a
// possible remote actor, but as a know local actor. This implies that the
// remote actor address either should be transformed to a local object, or
// be removed as a known entity the moment no addresses reference the remote
// actor any more.
//
// The consequence of the transformation property is indirection: The address
// cannot refer directly to the actor address, but to another object that knows
// the actor address, and can take the right message routing decisions depending
// on whether the actor is local, remote, or does not exist. The object
// referenced by the addresses will here be called an actor Identification.
//
// This Identification should only exist as long as there is an address
// referring to it. This could be implemented with some kind of registration
// process where an address register with the Identification object when it is
// created, and then de-register when the address is deleted. The benefit of
// this approach is that the Identification object knows which addresses that
// refers to it. The downside is that this is difficult to implement in a
// multi-threaded implementation since one thread could delete an address
// referring to the Identification and if it is the last address referring
// to this Identification, it should delete the Identification if it is an
// Identification of a remote object. However, if another thread at the very
// same time creates an address referring to the same Identification, it should
// not be deleted. Even if a mutex is used to guarantee that only one address
// can register or de-register at the same time, the order of these two
// operations cannot be predicted and the Identification object can be deleted
// when the next address tries to register.
//
// A simpler implementation, implicitly doing the same registration and
// de-registration would be to consider the addresses as smart pointer to the
// Identification. The Identification object will not know the address objects
// referring to it, but when the last address is removed, the Identification
// object's destructor would be called. A local actor can then just have an
// address to itself, pointing to its Identification object, and ensuring that
// this Identification object is removed when the actor is deleted.
//
// This is a cleaner implementation, but it does not overcome the problem of
// simultaneous deletion and creation of the addresses referring to the object.
// Another form of indirection would come to our rescue: There must be a way
// to refer to an actor, local or remote, by its string name or its numerical
// ID. Hence there must be two lookup tables with references to the
// Identification object. When the object is created, the references must be
// inserted in these lookup tables, and when the object is deleted the
// references must be deleted. Hence, having a mutex for insertions and
// deletions in this lookup table will work. If the deletion event happens
// first, the Identification will be deleted, and then when the creation event
// gets the mutex it will not find any Identification for the ID or the named
// string and assumed it will be a new, remote (or future local) actor and
// create another Identification object. If the creation event is handled first,
// then there will be an address holding a reference to the Identification
// object so the deletion of the other address will just decrement the count of
// references.
//

// Identification

//
// An actor has a name and a numerical ID. The latter must be unique independent

// during the actor's lifetime.

 Messages

// it is error prone. The current effort is motivated by the fact that null
// pointer messages happened frequently in a larger actor system bringing down
// the whole application and basically making Theron useless.
//
// The approach taken here is simply that each actor has its own message queue
// and that the send operation on one actor simply inserts the message into
// the message queue of the receiving actor. Thus, the message is created once,
// and deleted when it has been consumed. C++ and RTTI will have to take care
// of the polymorphic messages.
//
// The message stores the address of the sending actor, and has a method to
// be used by the queue handler when checking if it can be forwarded to the
// registered message handlers. The To address is not needed for messages sent
// to local actors, although it can be useful for debugging purposes. The To

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Synchronisation
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// In general, actors should proceed completely asynchronous. However, there is
// a particular pattern that makes this difficult: request - response. If an
// actor sends a request to another actor and expect a response there are two
// situations to consider: The response will not depend on the current actor
// state, and the actor can therefore continue normal message processing until
// the response arrived and is processed as a normal message. Alternatively,
// the actor should wait for the response to arrive, before processing any other
// message. This latter case is more difficult and requires some kind of
// synchronisation.
//
// Again, there are two cases to consider: 1) The actual content of the
// response has a meaning. In this case the actor should set up a Receiver and
// send the request as if it was from this receiver, and wait for the receiver
// to receive and handle the response before the necessary response content
// information is obtained from the receiver. Looking at the stack this means
// that the Postman runs a message handler, which blocks on a receiver.
// consequently no more messages will be processed by the actor during this
// wait, but they will be queued up. The response arriving to the Receiver
// will be processed as soon as it arrives since the Receiver is an actor that
// has its own Postman. Conceptually, this implies that the response message
// 'bypasses' the other messages to the actor and will be processed before the
// other messages in the actor's mailbox. The Receiver provides the necessary
// mechanism for implementing this, and it is the standard way to manage
// responses.
//
// 2) In this case the response is a simple acknowledgement from the other actor
// that the request has been received, and potentially processed. The sole fact
// that a message has arrived from the other actor is sufficient for this
// actor to continue processing, and then handle the acknowledgement at some
// later time according to the place of the message in the queue. Also this
// case can be implemented with a Receiver, although it would be better if the
// message handler could wait until a message arrives. To support this
// scenario, a special function is provided to wait for the arriving message,
// and the function terminates with the address of the sender of the last
// message in the queue to allow the waiting message handler to check if this
// was the right sender and potentially restart the wait if it was not.

// called from the actor itself, as it would cause the same type of deadlock
// as for the previous wait function, and it will throw a logic error if it is

// Waiting for a message to be processed is provided via the virtual call back

// actor model. It is better to implement actor synchronisation by a message
// protocol, although it may not always be possible because one could need to
// wait for an acknowledgement to be returned before continuing with the
