/*=============================================================================
  XMPP - Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol 
  
  This header defines the classes necessary to implement the XMPP [1] support 
  for Theron building on the transparent communication framework consisting of 
  the following hierarchy:
  
  (Physical link) <-> Network Layer <-> External message <-> Session Layer 
  <-> Presentation Layer::Message <-> Presentation Layer 
  <-> (User implemented actor)
  
  The actual link level XMPP transmission will be ensured by the Swiften 
  library [2] and it is used in the Link Server that adds a separate thread to
  support the communication. 
  
  The Session Layer generates the external Jabber IDs for the local actors 
  and register XMPP clients for these with the Link Server. The roster of the 
  XMPP client is queried when a local actor wants to send to a remote actor 
  whose Jabber ID is not already known by the protocol engine.
  
  The Presentation Layer is application dependent and not XMPP dependent, and so 
  it is not included in this implementation. 
  
  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:
  
  The author is grateful to Dr. Salvatore Venticinque of the Second University
  of Naples for the selection of the Swiften library, and for guiding 
  implementations of similar mechanism for the CoSSMic project that has been 
  the basis for the Network Layer implementation here. Without his kind help 
  this XMPP interface would never have happened.

// Another serious problem with Swiften is that it uses Boost::shared_ptr and 
// in many of the functions used to check the availability of some information
// this pointer is converted to a boolean. Implicitly it is tested for being 
// non-null, but it is correctly illegal to say
//    bool TestValue = Boost::shared_ptr<T>();  
// as no converter exists from a Boost::shared_ptr to bool. The boost library
// is well written, and it uses "explicit" as a way to prevent unintentional 
// use. However, the Swiften library uses only implicit conversions, and 
// we must therefore indicate to boost that this type of conversions should 
// be allowed by switching off the "explicit" conversions

  // ACTOR DISCOVERY
  // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  // In a pure peer-to-peer system a joining network endpoint needs to know 
  // about other network endpoints. The XMPP protocol offers us the opportunity
  // to go for an "any peer" approach: A new endpoint will only need one other
  // endpoint to connect to as follows:
  //
  // 	1) When the link starts it connects to the XMPP server at domain, with 
  //       the resource "endpoint" (e.g. as "EndPointName@domain/endpoint")
  // 	2) It then sends a presence to the initial peer it has been told about
  //  	3) Both peers undergo the subscribe-subscribed-available handshake
  // 	4) When the original peer receives the "available" message from another
  //	   peer with the "endpoint" resource it requests its own roster
  //	5) When it gets the roster it dispatches the roster to the new peer 
  //	   as a sequence of messages with subject "SUBSCRIBE" and payload the 
  //	   JabberID of each endpoint known to the original peer
  // 	6) When the joining endpoint gets these messages, it will "subscribe" 
  //	   to the remote agents (= initiating the handshake and thereby adding 
  //	   them to its own roster making it ready to serve new endpoints 
  //	   joining the system).
  //
  // The first two steps are being done in the XMPP Link's constructor, and 
  // the standard Presence Notification handler will deal with the handshake 
  // necessary in step 3) and it will initiate the rooster request. There is 
  // a dedicated function to request the roster that takes a callback function
  // to invoke when the roster is returned from the XMPP server.
  
  // The roster request is a function used whenever the roster should be 
  // checked: when a client is connected for the first time, when an external 
  // actor asks for this roster, or when an existing network endpoint detects 
  // that a new endpoint indicates that it is "available". It basically check  
  // that the local client ID is valid, and then use this client to construct 
  // the request that will call the callback function when the roster is 
  // received.
  //
  // Since this is intended to be used with lambda functions, the signature 
  // generally becomes nasty. In theory it should be possible to pass the lambda
  // as a standard function, but since the function arguments are based on 
  // Swift type definitions, these definitions are expanded in the signature but 
  // not in the lambda argument list when it is defined and the compiler
