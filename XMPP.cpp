  XMPP - Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol 

  This file contains the implementation of the methods for the Theron XMPP
  support classes as defined in the header file. 
  
  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:
  
  The author is grateful to Dr. Salvatore Venticinque of the Second University
  of Naples for the selection of the Swiften library, and for guiding 
  implementations of similar mechanism for the CoSSMic project that has been 
  the basis for the Network Layer implementation here. Without his kind help 
  this XMPP interface would never have happened.

// In order to facilitate the construction of a thread invoking a member 
// function on a class, use the reference utility class from the standard
// library found in the functional header.

#include <functional>

// The standard vector misses a find member function, and therefore the find
// function from the algorithms will be used instead.

#include <algorithm>

// Even though it is strictly unnecessary we include the boost shared pointers
// which is probably included by Swiften because it is based on Boost shared 
// pointers and not the standard library shared pointers. Unfortunately, 
// boost smart pointers cannot be converted to standard library smart pointers
// without deploying a clever trick, see
// http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12314967/cohabitation-of-boostshared-ptr-and-stdshared-ptr
// and therefore there are places in this implementation where boost smart 
// pointers must be directly used.

#include <boost/smart_ptr.hpp>

// Some networking headers are needed if we want to look up the IP of a symbolic
// address. This can be useful to detect if two clients are at the same server.

// Swiften returns a boost optional for the message body and it may be necessary
// to print this in error messages without first converting the optional to

// There is a need to figure out if the given agent discovery room is on the 
// local server or on a remote server. This could be as simple as just comparing 
// domains of the discovery server Jabber ID and the Jabber ID of the local 
// agent. However, it is not as easy as that since there is an old XMPP 
// convention to give extra modules sub-domains on the server. Hence a 
// Multi-User Chat (MUC) room on "server.location.eu" could conventionally be
// called "muc.server.location.eu". Hence, we have to compare the IP addresses
// of these servers. The official XMPP client connection (RFC 3920) port is 
// 5222 hence, hence the lookup is based on this port.
// 
// The actual lookup is done in two steps: First the server domain is converted
// to an IP address string, and then these two strings are compared. To look
// up the address of a server the getaddrinfo [3] function will be used and 
// the present code is basically the very nice example in Beej's Guide [4]. 
// TODO Implement cross platform support for Windows following TheComet's 
// example in his answer [5].

//
// The IP address lookup function is implemented first. For comparing the 
// server address, the IPv4 address is preferred if it is available. However, 
// if it is not available, the IPv6 address will be returned. For the sake of 
// comparison this would be sufficient because if one server has an IPv4 
// address and the others only an IPv6 address, well, then the two servers 
// are defined to be unequal. It returns a list of addresses known for the 
// given host, with a preference to IPv4 addresses.

  // will connect to the local XMPP server before sending its presence to the 
  // initial remote peer given. This initial remote peer will then send back 
  // the list of all agents it knows about (should be all agents connected to  
  // the system), and then this endpoint will subscribe to them too and thereby 
  // become fully connected. 
  //
  // The creation of this client is similar to what is done by the Create 
  // Client message handler, with different event handlers so it will not help
  // clarity to reuse create client handler.

  // may come available in the future.

  // Then this network endpoint will simply subscribe to this known endpoint
  // as soon as it is connected to the local XMPP server. However, it could
  // be that this endpoint is the very first endpoint in the system and 
  // in this case the known endpoint address will be invalid, and nothing 
  // should happen when we connect.

  // this client is registered with +128 as priority. This priority will be
